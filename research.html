                    <li>Proposed a FeaCD net for recognizing vehicle, ship and so on. It incorporates domain knowledge to effectively supervise model optimization. This approach significantly reduces data volume requirements. Compared to existing methods, even when the sample size is reduced by 5-10 times, the ships recognition rates still exceed 70%.</li>
                    <li>The proposed methods are fundamental processes for areas such as land use, maritime rescue and so on. Publications include <strong>ISPRS JPRS</strong>, <strong>IEEE TGRS</strong> and others.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Multimodal Information Retrieval for Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proposed a method introducing the coreset concept to clean multimodal datasets. It enhances the performance of recognizing semantic relations between instances within images. The method has boosted recall ratios by ~50% compared to existing methods.</li>
                    <li>The proposed method can be extended for use with combinations of various modalities. Accepted by <strong>ACM MM 2023</strong> with full scores.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Proposed CrossFuser, a dual-stage fusion framework for indoor 3D object detection using multi-view mmWave radar. It decouples radar geometry modeling from cross-view feature fusion to address spatial inconsistency and severe multipath noise.</li>
                    <li>Achieved state-of-the-art detection performance on benchmark indoor datasets under challenging conditions like occlusion and electromagnetic clutter. Submitted to <strong>AAAI 2026</strong>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Camera-Radar Fusion for 3D Objective Detection in Automotive Driving</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proposed CIFM-Fusion, a coarse-to-fine radar-camera fusion framework that decouples semantic alignment from feature fusion, mitigating radar-camera misalignment caused by resolution anisotropy.</li>
                    <li>Outperformed existing fusion methods on the nuScenes benchmark, with significant reduction in offset errors, demonstrating strong robustness under adverse driving conditions. Submitted to <strong>AAAI 2026</strong>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Biomedical Volume Reconstruction and Prediction</h3>

                <h4>3D Fluorescence Microscopy Long-term Live-cell Imaging</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proposed a dual Cycle-consistent Diffusion framework (VTCD) to simultaneously denoise and super-resolve 3D cell volumes in an unsupervised manner, overcoming issues of spatially varying noise and insufficient axial resolution.</li>
                    <li>Experimental results on 10 in vivo cellular datasets show significant improvements in both denoising and super-resolution, with axial resolution enhanced from ~430nm to ~90nm, enabling clearer and more accurate long-term live-cell imaging. Accepted by <strong>CVPR 2025</strong> as <font color="#FF4D50"><strong>Highlight</strong></font>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Information Perception for Assisted Diagnosis of Glomerular Diseases</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Under the guidance of professional doctors of Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital in China, I was responsible for organizing the pixel-level annotation of 1615 glomerular morphological lesions, including segmental sclerosis, crescent, and sclerosis.</li>
                    <li>Proposed the EdgeSharp segmentor, pioneering in research semantic segmentation of glomerular morphological lesions with the mIoU and mPA of 67.91% and 77.06%, respectively.</li>
