                    <p class="research-card__text">Proposed CIFM-Fusion, a coarse-to-fine radar-camera fusion framework that decouples semantic alignment from feature fusion, mitigating radar-camera misalignment caused by resolution anisotropy.</p>
                    <p class="research-card__text">Outperformed existing fusion methods on the nuScenes benchmark, with significant reduction in offset errors, demonstrating strong robustness under adverse driving conditions. Submitted to <strong>AAAI 2026</strong>.</p>
